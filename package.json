  "description": "<<<<<<< HEAD Main idea: Create an app that the site RME team can use to better faciliate communcications between different shifts. The main tools currently used are Slack and a locally generate Excel passdown spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is posted at the end of each shift to slack. The propsed app would store the information in a database. This app would have a home page with general site info and will display alerts for  critical info from the previous shit passdown eliminating the need for the tech to search through general shift passdown for crtical info.  The app will also inculde a safety section. Currently printed copy of safety standowns and infor is posted in the shop with a sign off sheet. This app will include a safety page with the capability that will allow the tech to review and mark the standown as complete and store this inforamtion in a database as completed.  The safety page will also allow for the manager to post safety info for the site in real-time.",
